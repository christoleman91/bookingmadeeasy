                    <p id="textAbout">Hello everyone and thank you for taking the time to participate in my project. So what I am trying to
                        do it create a website to aid people in picking a hotel in the most simple fashion. I want to do this by using your feedback/data to make changes and redesigns so they are more suited
                        to the customer base (you). </p>
                    <p id="textAbout"> There are minimal features implemented at the moment but this is the first iteration. The likes of the booking
                        page will say you've completed a booking but it doesn't actually book anything, so don't worry about
                        using actual details. I am using the goldie locks principle which simply means offering 3 options
                        to the user to minimise search and decision making. This is just a basic first prototype so you can
                        get a feel and understanding of what it should do.</p>
                    <p id="textAbout">What i need from everyone is basically just your opinions, thoughts,constructive criticism, what you
                        like/don't like, things you found easy/hard. Obviously with this being a basic first iteration there
                        isn't a whole lot of complexity but even comments on colour, layout, fonts, images etc is all extremely
                        useful. Even if the only feedback you give is on a colour, that's helpful. </p>
                    <p id="textAbout">I will keep in touch via Facebook and would like to remind you that there will be a few more iterations until the final design so if you can bare with me and help me as much it will be greatly appreciated and the more feedback the better. I will raffle a gift at the end to a random person as a thank you. If you click the button to the left it should open your email with my email address linked and you can submit your feedback to my email. If you don't want to do that, just leave a comment on the facebook page so you leave some initial feedback. Thanks again. </p>
